# TypeScript CRUD Manager

TypeScript CRUD Manager is a simple program that allows you to create, edit, view, and delete items in a SQLite database.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

*Refer to 'Development Environment' section before attempting to run the program*
1. Open a terminal in your IDE, make sure the current directory is the root project directory. Run 'npm run dev'. This will start the backend of the program.
